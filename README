A simple script for symetrically encrypting a file.

It simply decrypts the file into a file readable only by you, you edit it in your favorite editor, and then it rencrypts it and saves the file back where it came from.

I use this to keep track of my web passwords.

Usage : 

$ ./gpg-encrypt.sh 
No filename specified. Using default passwords.gpg
Password: 
passwords.gpg doesn't exist. Starting from empty file.
<editor pops up and you edit your file. Once you exit it saves it encrypted>

To change your editor (in bash) :
$ export EDITOR=pico
$ ./gpg-encrypt.sh 
<now pico pops up>
